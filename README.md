Copy the following code into ISE or Visual Studio code. The code below works with PowerShell 5.1 only, because the AppxModule is not available in PowerShell 7. (Workaround: Import-Module Appx -UseWindowsPowerShell)

Note that you need to enter the latest version of Windows Terminal in line 2. It is a URL and I am using version 1.16 in this post.
